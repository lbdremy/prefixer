Convert infix arithmetic expression to prefix expression.
Take account of these symbols: ( ) / * + - and respect operator precedence.
All values are either single alphabetic characters or positive integers.


Usage: ./prefixer [OPTION] SOURCE

[OPTION] not mandatory:
-r : Reduce the expression as much as possible before the output.

Example:
>./prefixer folder/expression
(3+v)/9*2+3 becomes (+ 3(* 2(/ 9(+ v 3))))
